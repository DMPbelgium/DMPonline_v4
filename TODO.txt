  which is a fork of DMPonline_v4 (once in a time)

  fixed seed file: https://github.com/softwaresaved/smp-service/blob/eaea66804be50feaab12a5b01b58a6121eef94c2/db/seeds.rb

  referenced seed is actually better than the seed from dmponline!
  when issuing db:seed and error occurs (see following)

- fix gem lederman/rails-settings

  case: bundle exec rake db:seed throws this error:

    ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::Error: Can't mass-assign protected attributes: var, target

  cause: gem protected_attributes
  fixes:
    https://github.com/ledermann/rails-settings/issues/59 (works)

      create initializer and put this code in it:

        RailsSettings::SettingObject.class_eval do
          attr_accessible :var, :target
        end

- add yourself as super-admin

  User.first.roles << Role.create(:name => "admin")

- add yourself as org_admin

  User.first.roles << Role.create(:name => "org_admin")

- create template without organisation: the index page of dmptemplate fails to render!

- too much manual linking of data in the admin interface (error prone)

  e.g. there should be a button "add phase to template", which includes the id of the parent template (like in the modals in rails_admin)
       now you have to add a phase, and find the appropriate template for it.
       phases should not have their own form, only a subform, for they exist only as children.

- disable shiboleth in config/application.rb

  config.shibboleth_enabled = false

  => maar dit doet niets (links blijven bestaan)
  config.shibboleth_login blijft nodig!

- read https://github.com/softwaresaved/smp-service/blob/smp-docs/ConceptsDataModel.md for conceptual guidance
- when model validation fails in the interface, there is no visual feedback in the interface (simply reloads the form)
  e.g. add phase without template selected

- export plan:

  docx fails (xslt in gem not found)
