    body_text_tab_1_html: "<p>Properly managing research data starts with good planning,
    for example by preparing a data management plan (DMP). This is a document that specifies
    how you will handle your data during and after a research project. International
    funding bodies increasingly require their researchers to produce DMPs, but preparing a
    plan is good practice for any research project generating data.</p>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <p>This tool includes a number of DMP templates. There are templates for Ghent University researchers responding to DMP requirements of a specific research funder or faculty, as well as a generic template based on international best practices for researchers not completing a particular funder or faculty DMP. When creating a new plan, users are asked a number of questions first so that we can determine the appropriate template to display. Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by research funders, Ghent University and/or specific faculties.</p>
    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>If you have a valid UGent username and password you can sign in and start.  You will be directed to the ‘My plans’ page. From here you can create, edit, share, export or delete any of your plans. You will also see plans that have been shared with you by others. Please visit the ‘Help’ page for guidance. If you have any questions or comments about DMPonline.be, <a href='mailto:info@dmponline.be'>please contact us.</a></p>"

    body_text_tab_2_html: "<p>DMPonline was originally developed by the UK’s Digital Curation Centre (DCC)
    to assist researchers with writing an effective DMP. DCC has made the source code
    available under a GNU Affero General Public License to permit others to reuse the code
    freely.</p>
    <p>Ghent University Library has installed an instance of DMPonline (version 4.1 released by the Digital Curation Centre in May 2015) to customise the tool for its researchers. All data is locally hosted. We share the source code for any extensions on <a href='https://github.com/Universiteitsbibliotheek/DMPonline_v4'>Github</a>.</p>
    <p>To further maintain and develop the tool we cooperating with other academic institutions in Belgium. In fact, we set up our Ghent University instance as a pilot for a shared DMPonline.be platform, where common DMP templates (e.g. for external funders) can be added, new releases can be processed for multiple institutions at once, and new features can be co-developed. If you are interested in collaborating with us on DMPonline.be, <a href='mailto:info@dmponline.be'>please contact us.</a></p>"

    body_text_tab_2_html: "<p>DMPonline is developed and maintained by the UK Digital Curation Centre. We’re a small team, and are happy to collaborate with others. There are various ways you can get involved:</p>
    <h3>Join the user group</h3>
    <p>We want to engage with our users more actively so invite you to join the user group. We run a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DMPONLINE-USER-GROUP'>listserv</a> for the group that you can request to join. We also host periodic meetings to consult on our plans</p>
    <p>Our user group sessions are usually focused around a certain topic (e.g. fleshing out use cases for an API) so invites are sent based on your areas of expertise. It is also helpful for us to know what type of user you are –researcher, institutional administrator, librarian, developer, funder etc.</p>
    <p>Please let us know your interests and share your ideas for future developments via the mailing list so the community as a whole can feedback on them.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Customise DMPonline</h3>
    <p>DMPonline can be customised by institutions and disciplines. You can add templates for users in your organisation and tailored guidance that explains local support and services. Example answers can also be offered to help users understand what to write in a Data Management Plan. To do this you’ll need to request admin access, so please email us on <a href='mailto:info@dmponline.be?Subject=DMPonline%20Admin%20access' target='_top'>info@dmponline.be</a>.</p>
    <p>Futher guidance on customising DMPonline is available on the <a href='http://www.dcc.ac.uk/dmponline' target='_blank'>DCC website</a>.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Contribute to the code</h3>
    <p>DMPonline is a Ruby on Rails application. The source code is made available under a GNU Affero General Public License. This permits others to reuse the code freely, but obligates you to share the source code for any extensions in the same way. Please inform us if you install an instance of DMPonline and offer your contributions back to the community.</p>
    <p>If you install an instance of DMPonline we require that you credit the DCC as originators of the tool. We recommend that the acknowledgement takes the form of the DMPonline logo with a link back to the DCC-hosted version of the tool.</p>
    <p>We are willing to work with external developers to add new features to the tool. We are also open to delivering new features on a chargeable basis. If there are extensions you would like to see prioritised and have resource to support additional developer effort, please contact us on info@dmponline.be to negotiate terms.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Support our work</h3>
    <p>We are impressed by the uptake of DMPonline both in the UK and internationally and are really keen to hear  how you are using the tool and promoting it in your context. We are aware that others have run training courses, developed guidance materials and advocated use of the tool. Please notify us of this as it helps to show impact.</p>
    <p>We are currently investigating options for revenue generation. This will help us serve the increased demand more effectively and safeguard the long-term sustainability of DMPonline. Plans will be released for consultation soon but we also welcome your suggestions on how best to support our work.</p> "
