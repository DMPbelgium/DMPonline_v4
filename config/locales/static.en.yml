    body_text_tab_1_html: "<p>Properly managing research data starts with good planning,
    for example by preparing a data management plan (DMP). This is a document that specifies
    how you will handle your data during and after a research project. International
    funding bodies increasingly require their researchers to produce DMPs, but preparing a
    plan is good practice for any research project generating data.</p>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <p>This tool includes a number of DMP templates. There are templates for Consortium member researchers responding to DMP requirements of a specific research funder, as well as institutional templates (which may be institution-wide, or associated with a subgroup within the institution, such as a faculty or research group). When creating a new plan, users are asked a number of questions first so that we can determine the appropriate template to display. Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by research funders, Consortium member institutions, or a subgroup within the institution.</p>
    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>If you have a valid institutional email from a DMPbelgium Consortium member that is part of the Belnet Federation, you can sign in and start. If your institution is a member of the DMPbelgium Consortium but not part of the Belnet Federation, you can sign in via ORCID. When you sign in, you will be directed to your profile page. From there you can easily navigate to the 'view plans' menu on top to edit, share, export or delete any of your plans. You will also see plans that have been shared with you by others. Please visit the 'Help' page for guidance.</p>
    <p>If your institution is not a member of DMPbelgium, you can sign in with ORCID and view plans that have been shared with you, but you will not be able to create new plans yourself.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or comments about DMPonline.be, or if your institution would like to become a member of DMPbelgium, <a href='mailto:info@dmponline.be'>please contact us.</a></p>"

    body_text_tab_2_html: "<p>DMPonline was originally developed by the UK’s Digital Curation Centre (DCC) to assist researchers with writing an effective DMP. DCC has made the source code available under a GNU Affero General Public License to permit others to reuse the code freely.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Ghent University Library installed a local instance of DMPonline (version 4.1 released by the Digital Curation Centre in May 2015) to customise the tool for its researchers. From its inception, DMPonline.be was also set up as a pilot for a fully localised, collective version of the tool for research and educational institutions in Belgium.</p>
    <p>In January 2017, the DMPbelgium Consortium was founded by Universiteit Gent, Instituut voor Natuur- en Bosonderzoek, Universiteit Antwerpen, Universiteit Hasselt, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Vrije Universiteit Brussel en Wetenschappelijk Instituut Volksgezondheid - Institut Scientifique de Santé Publique to develop DMPonline.be into a shared data management planning tool for users from participating institutions. In 2018, the consortium expanded to include Université Catholique de Louvain, Université de Liège, Université de Mons, Université de Namur and Vlaamse Instelling voor Technologisch Onderzoek. All data is hosted on Belnet servers, and we share the source code for any extensions on <a href='https://github.com/DMPbelgium/DMPonline_v4'>Github</a>.</p>
    <p>DMPonline.be offers common DMP templates (e.g. for external research funders relevant to the Belgian context) alongside institutional templates and guidance. Through a collaborative approach, a duplication of efforts can be avoided, costs can be saved and expertise can be shared for the maintenance and further development of the tool (e.g. processing of new releases, development of new features). If you are interested in becoming a member of the DMPbelgium Consortium, <a href='mailto:info@dmponline.be'>please contact us</a>.</p>"

    <h2>2. Information We Collect and How We Collect It</h2>

    <p>DMPbelgium collects information from users of the Websites in four ways: information you
    directly give us; information given to us by third parties; information we collect from your use
    of the Websites; and information we collect from cookies, also known as tracking
    technologies.</p>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Give Us</h3>

    <p>You can use DMPonline to write a Data Management Plan for your research. We securely store the
    information you enter in these areas of our Websites for you. Therefore, to use DMPonline, you
    must create a DMPonline Account.</p>

    <p>To register with DMPonline, you are not required to be affiliated with one of our Members;
    however, certain features (e.g. creating a new DMP) are only available to users affiliated with a
    Member.</p>

    <p>If you want to create a DMPonline Account, DMPbelgium requires you to provide at minimum your
    email address. Additionally, you may also include additional information about yourself such as
    your first name and last name. DMPonline will associate your Account information (e.g., name and
    email address) with your activities creating and updating DMPs (with your collaborators) for your
    research projects.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Information Provided by Others</h3>

    <p><strong>Trusted Individuals</strong></p>

    <p>Your Trusted Individuals may edit and add information in your DMPs. You may specifically
    designate or remove Trusted Individuals in the DMPonline Website via the Share page of your
    DMP.</p>

    <p><strong>Identity Provider</strong></p>

    <p>You may sign in to our Website using sign-in services from your institution if they are active
    as Identity Provider within the BELNET ID Federation. These services will authenticate you and
    validate your email address with a security token. This technical data is stored in the DMPonline
    system to enable you to sign in. These services are built to ensure that DMPonline cannot know
    your password.</p>

    <p>Through the BELNET ID Federation, your institution provides you with the option to share
    certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate your
    DMPonline Account.</p>

    <p><strong>ORCID</strong></p>

    <p>You may sign in to our Website using sign-in services from ORCID. These services will
    authenticate your identity and validate your email address with a security token. This technical
    data is stored in the DMPonline system to enable you to sign in. These services are built to
    ensure that DMPonline cannot know your password.</p>

    <p>ORCID also provides you with the option to share certain personal information with us such as
    your name and email address to pre-populate your DMPonline Account. To be able to validate your
    email address, we request permission to read from your ORCID Record, according to the privacy
    preferences you set at ORCID. DMPonline will not change information in your ORCID Record.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Information DMPbelgium Collects from your Use of the Websites</h3>

    <p>DMPbelgium will collect information about your use of the Websites. We do this for a variety
    of reasons, including to monitor when and by whom DMP information has been changed, to help
    identify and block some spammers, and also to monitor traffic on the Websites.</p>

    <p>When you access our Websites, we collect certain information using server tools, including
    details such as your IP address, the type and version of the Internet browser that is being used,
    the site from which the visitor accesses our Websites, the type of device being used (e.g.
    computer, smart phone, tablet), or the screen resolution; and details about usage, including page
    traffic. We may combine this automatically collected log information to other information we
    collect about you. DMPbelgium will ensure anonymization of these log data after 18 months at the
    latest.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Information from Cookies and other Tracking Technologies</h3>

    <p>You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you
    may still use our Websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be
    limited.</p>

    <p>We and our service providers use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer
    the Websites, track users’ movements around the Websites and to gather demographic information
    about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by
    these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. DMPbelgium will ensure
    anonymization of all data for these providers before it leaves our Websites.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We use the information we collect only to operate, protect, evaluate and improve the Websites,
    and DMPonline operations generally.</p>

    <p>We may contact you about your use of the DMPbelgium Websites:</p>

    <ul class='list-simple'>
      <li>As DMPbelgium Member, your research institution may contact you about your use of the
      DMPbelgium Websites or related matters.</li>

      <li>We will use your email address to contact you with service messages related to or affecting
      your DMPbelgium use, including, without limitation: changes to our Privacy Policy or
      functionality that affects how a user manages privacy; changes to Terms and Conditions; changes
      to registration procedures or fields included; changes in the type of information collected. As
      this information may affect your visibility (privacy) settings and the functioning of
      DMPbelgium for you, you may not opt-out of service messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may share aggregated or summarized usage data with our Members or others in the research
    community or publish information based on aggregated usage data so Members and others can
    understand how the DMPonline Websites are being used. We will only do so in a way that your
    personal identity is protected.</p>

    <h2>4. Choices You Have About Sharing Information</h2>

    <p>A core DMPbelgium principle is that your data is considered confidential. To that end,
    DMPonline allows you to control how your DMPs are shared with other DMPonline users as Trusted
    Individuals and how they can be exported (e.g. to be published or to be included in a grant
    application).</p>

    <h3>4.1 Default Settings for Sharing</h3>

    <p>Data which you have entered into a DMP may be viewed through the Websites only by you and any
    Trusted Individuals you designate.</p>

    <p>DMP data is not shared with the public or with Members of DMPbelgium. When you create a DMP,
    you are the owner of the data in that DMP. You cannot use DMPbelgium Websites to make any element
    visible on the public Internet, you have to export the DMP and publish elsewhere.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Trusted Individuals</h3>

    <p>Trusted Individuals you designate, are granted access on a DMP per DMP basis. You will choose
    their level of access when you invite them and can change these permissions at any time. A
    Trusted Individual can act on your behalf in different roles:</p>

    <ul class='list-simple'>
      <li>Read only</li>

      <li>Edit</li>

      <li>Data contact</li>

      <li>Principal investigator</li>

      <li>Co-owner</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A Trusted Individual in the role \"Read only\" can only view the information in your DMP.</p>

    <p>A Trusted Individual in the roles \"Edit\" and \"Data contact\" will be able to view and
    contribute to your DMP.</p>

    <p>A Trusted Individual in the roles \"Co-owner\" and \"Principal Investigator\" can view and
    contribute to your DMP, edit plan details, and add as well as remove other Trusted Individuals to
    and from your DMP.</p>

    <p>Therefore, you should only grant Trusted Individual status to a person you trust. DMPbelgium
    cannot control how a Trusted Individual will interact with your DMP. You may revoke Trusted
    Individual status at any time via the Sharing page of your DMP.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Changing Settings</h3>

    <p>You can change your settings for sharing a DMP at any time. However, the new settings will
    only apply after you have made the change. DMPbelgium has no control over uses of data already
    made available via the Websites or disclosures made in places other than the Websites.</p>

    <h2>5. How We Share Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law, DMPbelgium does not share
    any information about you with other parties. For example, we do not share or sell your
    information to marketers, advertisers or other entities.</p>

    <h3>5.1 With authenticated users of DMPonline</h3>

    <p>Your designated Trusted Individuals have access to all of the information in the DMPs you
    granted them access to, but not to your (entire) Account. According to the levels of access you
    grant them, they will be able to change the information in your DMP and/or invite further Trusted
    Individuals. You can change settings for sharing your DMP at any time.</p>

    <h3>5.2 With DMPbelgium Members</h3>

    <p>DMPbelgium Members cannot access any element from your DMP unless you share a DMP with their
    staff.</p>

    <p>Selected admin users of DMPonline at your own institution can</p>

    <ul class='list-simple'>
      <li>know that you are using DMPbelgium Websites and</li>

      <li>list active users' email addresses and</li>

      <li>know how many DMPs you have and</li>

      <li>know the time and date of your last login.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Under DMPbelgium's Consortium Agreement, Members agree not to disclose any personal or
    otherwise confidential data unless (i) such data is publicly available from another source, or
    (ii) the Member has separate agreements with you about how and to whom such data will be
    disclosed.</p>

    <h3>5.3 With our Contractors</h3>

    <p>We may share your information with agents or contractors (for example, BELNET is hosting
    DMPbelgium's servers, or a contractor may need to check backup data for inconsistencies), but
    only on a \"need to know\" basis to help us operate DMPonline, and only if the vendor agrees to
    maintain the confidentiality and security of your information and not to use it for other
    purposes. These companies are authorized to use your personal data only as necessary to provide
    these services to us.</p>

    <h3>5.4 Government Data Requests</h3>

    <p>If we are required by law, public safety or public policy, or by the courts, we may provide
    your information to regulators, enforcement agents, courts and/or other government entities. To
    protect the privacy interests of our users, DMPbelgium will provide only the minimum of data as
    we deem necessary in the situation. To the extent allowed, we will promptly provide information
    about any government data requests received and accounts affected to the relevant DMP owners.</p>

    <h3>5.5 International Data Transfer</h3>

    <p>Note that we store and process personal data on servers located in Belgium on the BELNET
    network. DMPbelgium will not transfer your personal data to facilities outside the BELNET network
    or share them with third parties other than described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>Backups may be stored outside the BELNET network for added security, but not outside of
    Belgium.</p>

    <h2>6. Access, Review, Editing and Changing Data</h2>

    <p>You may review, delete, and edit information in your DMPs in DMPonline and change Account
    details. Please note that changes will be applied prospectively. For example, if you change a
    setting for sharing, there is no way to stop people who have previously viewed or downloaded the
    data from using it.</p>

    <ul class='list-simple'>
      <li>You only need to sign in to DMPonline to review and change information in your DMP and
      change your settings for sharing your DMPs. You can also select to delete a DMP entirely. This
      operation cannot be undone.</li>

      <li>You may update your first/last name at any time using the \"Edit profile\" page.</li>

      <li>You cannot update your email from DMPbelgium Websites as it is assigned by your Identity
      Provider and validated through the BELNET ID Federation and/or ORCID.</li>

      <li>You cannot update your password from DMPbelgium Websites as it is a secret protected by
      your BELNET Identity Provider or by ORCID.</li>

      <li>You may choose to deactivate your DMPonline Account from the \"Edit profile\" page of your
      Account. In the event that a DMPonline Account is canceled, we will maintain as private your
      DMPs for a period of 18 months, to allow you to re-claim your data in the future.</li>

      <li>You may associate your DMPonline Account with ORCID or de-associate it at any time using
      the \"Edit profile\" page. As long as you are not affiliated with a Member, associating your
      Account with ORCID is required and cannot be undone.</li>

      <li>If you discover that you accidentally have more than one DMPonline Account, you may combine
      the Accounts by associating both with the same ORCID.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In limited circumstances, DMPbelgium may proactively correct data in an Account where errors
    are a result of system errors, changed standards specifications, or other obvious errors not
    caused by you or your Trusted Individuals. To ensure transparency of our processes, we will post
    information on our websites when we make changes.</p>

    <h2>7. Email deactivated by the Identity Provider</h2>

    <p>A DMPonline Account that was created when you were still affiliated with an Identity Provider
    is maintained as is when the institution deactivates your email address, according to the
    following:</p>

    <ul class='list-simple'>
      <li>DMP data, settings sharing, and Trusted Individual designations remain as set by you before
      being deactivated by the Identity Provider.</li>

      <li>If you granted access to your DMP(s) to one or more Trusted Individuals, such persons may
      continue to view and edit the DMP data as per the permission levels you selected.</li>

      <li>If you linked your DMPonline Account with ORCID, you may continue to manage the data as
      before, using your ORCID to sign in.</li>

      <li>If your Identity Provider reassigns your deactivated email to another person, they are
      assumed by DMPbelgium to rightfully take over the management of your existing DMPonline Account
      and the associated DMPs. You, the new DMPonline Account holder and Trusted Individuals for any
      of the DMPs may request that DMPbelgium splits up the Accounts.</li>

      <li>No indication is made by DMPbelgium to highlight DMPs of deceased persons, though Trusted
      Individuals, at their discretion, could use existing fields to provide this detail, if desired,
      for example, including such information in the DMP description, or after the person’s
      name.</li>

      <li>If DMPbelgium is contacted to remove or correct data for someone who is deceased, the
      requestor will be referred to the DMP's Trusted Individual(s), or, if needed, the request will
      be handled by DMPonline admin users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Account Deactivated by DMPbelgium</h2>

    <p>Your DMPonline Account can be deactivated by DMPbelgium:</p>

    <ul class='list-simple'>
      <li>If you have not created any DMPs and the Identity Provider has deactivated your email.</li>

      <li>If you have not signed in to DMPonline Websites for at least 100 months.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will retain your information for as long as your Account is active, or as needed to provide
    you with our services, including reactivation. We will retain and use your information as
    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <h2>9. Transparency &amp; Complaints</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by and any disputes shall be resolved under the laws and
    courts of Belgium.</p>

    <p>If you have any concerns or claims with respect to our Privacy Policy or any other issue
    relating to our Websites, please contact DMPbelgium at <a href=
    'https://dmponline.be/about_us'>https://dmponline.be/about_us</a>. We will investigate and
    attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding our processing of personal data.</p>

    <p>DMPbelgium provides Websites for an audience of researchers and does not offer services
    directed to children. Should a child whom we know to be under 16 send personal data to us, we
    will delete that information immediately. Parents may also contact us (details at <a href=
    'https://dmponline.be/about_us'>https://dmponline.be/about_us</a>) to request removal of any
    personal data about a minor.</p>

    <p>We will review your concerns and will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
    DMPbelgium reserves the right (but shall not be required) to remove or hide from the Website and
    its servers any DMP data that violates the privacy, publicity or other rights of any person, is
    the subject of a dispute, or for any other good cause, including without limitation, in any
    situation in which DMPbelgium is advised by legal counsel that the retention of such data poses a
    legal risk to DMPbelgium.</p>

    <p>If you are not able to resolve your concerns through DMPbelgium’s internal mechanism, under
    GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with DPA, the <a href=
    'https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/'>Belgian Supervisory Authority</a>.</p>

    <h2>10. Information Security</h2>

    <p>We are committed to protecting the Websites and our users from unauthorized access or
    unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data in the Websites or which we
    otherwise hold. For example:</p>

    <ul class='list-simple'>
      <li>We store information about you in a data center with restricted access, and we use a
      variety of technical security measures to secure your data. We also use secure socket layer
      (SSL) technology and intrusion detection and virus protection software.</li>

      <li>We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices,
      including physical security measures.</li>

      <li>We restrict access to personal data to DMPonline admin users, contractors and agents who
      need to know that information to manage the Websites and who are subject to confidentiality
      obligations.</li>

      <li>We restrict access to information marked as shared with other users to (i) Trusted
      Individuals granted permissions by you, and (ii) DMPonline admin users, contractors, and agents
      with a need to know to manage the Websites and who are subject to confidentiality
      obligations.</li>

      <li>All passwords are protected by a salted hash, and passwords and security tokens are not
      visible by DMPonline admin users, contractors or agents, or even you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not be able to hack
    our system or otherwise defeat our security measures.</p>

    <p>Your access to our services is password protected. To maintain the security of your data (or
    of information in another person’s DMP that you are authorized to view), please keep your
    username(s) and password(s) strictly confidential and do not disclose them to anyone. We also
    recommend that you sign out of your Account at the end of each session. You may also wish to
    close your browser window when you have finished your work, especially if you share a computer
    with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. You will be solely responsible for
    any action, activities, and access to our Websites that were taken through your username and
    password, and that occurred before you notified us of their loss.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about security on our Websites, please contact DMPbelgium at
    <a href='https://dmponline.be/about_us'>https://dmponline.be/about_us</a>.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to this Policy</h2>

    <p>We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy
    Policy on this page. Your continued use of the Websites will be deemed conclusive acceptance of
    modifications. Please check this Privacy Policy from time to time for changes. We will not reduce
    your rights under this Privacy Policy with respect to data previously added without your
    consent.</p>

    <p>If in our discretion we think that any changes are significant, we will take additional steps
    to inform you (for example, by posting a notice of changes on our Websites and/or by sending you
    an email to inform of such changes) prior to the change becoming effective and obtain your
    consent through an opt-in mechanism (for example, by having you agree to the changes the next
    time you log onto the Websites or clicking an \"I consent\" button in an email).</p>"
